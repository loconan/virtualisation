At Robur our focus is on the software we develop. We are passionate about our work and believe in the importance of creating and maintaining secure digital infrastructure.

We get our funding through three avenues: grants for particular open-source projects, contracts for specific work including development and auditing, and public donations that help allow us to continue the work that isn't otherwise funded.

We spend most of our funding on salaries, ensuring Robur keeps developing the software we think is important. We do not spend money on fancy parties or first class business trips. Our general breakdown of spending per year is:
* 83% on salaries
* 7% on necessary travel
* 10% on inevitable administrative costs

If you are considering [donating](/Donate) to us, [hiring](/Our%20Work/Services) us, or [giving us a grant](/Contact) you can be assured your money will be well spent on the actual end result of delivering the robust and secure digital infrastructure we strive for.
