Twice a year the Robur team meet with others from the OCaml and MirageOS community at a week long hack retreat in Marrakesh, Morocco.

We use these times to discuss and learn about new developments in the MirageOS ecosystem and meet in person about our Robur projects. And of course we have fun whilst we are at it!


The retreats are held in a hostel in the center of the city, which we wholly rent out for the period, with food provided. If you are interested in participating in the next retreat please [see the MirageOS site](http://retreat.mirage.io/) for more details and sign-up method.
