We are passionate about creating secure and reliable open source infrastructure. We have worked on secure implementations of important applications such as [OpenPGP](/Our%20Work/Projects#OpenPGP) and DNS.

Unfortunately such projects aren't always easy to get full grants for, and public donations really help us in completing such work.

If you want to assist us continue these projects we would be grateful for a donation and promise to spend your money well (for more information on how we spend the funds we get please see our [funding page](/About%20Us/Funding)).
